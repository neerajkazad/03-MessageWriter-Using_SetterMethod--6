Program No: 6
In this program we are using Setter method to achieve loose coupling.
So every class in this project is loosely coupled except the Test class.
So this is the best approach but not fully loosely couple.
So to achieve fully loosely coupling we have to go for Properties files and using properties collection we can make our classes
fully loosely coupled to see the solution refer:""
